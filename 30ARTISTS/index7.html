      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       I chose Chimera because it’s a greek mythological creature. I’ve always been interested in shapeshifters,
       like Nue in Japanese mythology. I think it goes with the idea of being a nightlife personality.
       It only makes sense if I named myself after something that’s shapeshifting.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      Honestly, even tho it’s super fun to serve a full look, most of the time I have more fun if i’m just beat and gorgeous.
      I love the idea of going to a club and just make out with complete strangers.
      I also love the nights where you meet some great people.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently working on my fashion design degree so being a club kid actually derived from my designs.
      I also love playing around with makeup.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

  Berlin Queens! They are all so gorgeous from head to toe. They are like people from a different planet.
  Isshe Hungry is absolutely inspiring cuz I also love to play with the proportion of my face when painting
