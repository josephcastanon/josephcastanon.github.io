      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       I am named Linux after the computer operating system. It's super popular and quick software,
        however it's known to glitch ALOT and be a bit problematic...malware ensues.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      My first night at Susanne Bartsch's ON TOP! It was also my first party I've ever been to in NYC.
      The venue, the people, the looks, and energy I felt that night is why I am still in Nightlife!

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Tall, Wide, Loud.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
    I love studying PR & consumerism culture. It's super entertaining to me what the media thinks our
     mainstream minds want to see. I can spend all day watching a shitty reality show or researching a
    moment in popular culture, where actually I'm so into studying deeper details of what made those PR
     moments so iconic.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

  My biggest inspiration is ever changing. One minute it's someone in nightlife, the next it's a fashion designer,
  a week later an author. Right now it is Amanda Lepore. She embodies all three of those things as well as beauty,
  being a transgender pioneer & existing in NYC nightlife for multiple decades.
