      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My club name is a nickname I've had my entire life. When I started working in night life it seemed to fit as my name so I kept it.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    I wouldn't say that there is one night in particular that stood out over the rest. To me, an amazing night is defined by those around me.
    I love seeing all of my friends hanging out in great looks, having fun and enjoying the party.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

      My biggest inspirations would have to be my friends. At first I was getting all of my inspo through instagram,
      following an array of different artists, but once I got established in nightlife it was way more inspiring seeing my
      friends out every night continuously coming up with amazing, challenging looks. It makes me feel like I need to keep up with everyone!
