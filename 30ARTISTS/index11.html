      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      Magdalena is my birth name. It's actually Maria Magdalena and I liked the idea of mixing the holy and
       ominous undertones with pop culture.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    Actually, last week at the last Sunday Battle Hymn was one of the most magical experiences. Towards the end of the night as
     Honey Dijon was DEMOLISHING us on the altar, the music faded as Javier Ninja rose up onto the side railing. He started vogueing
    and every person stopped and turned to watch him. The lights were hitting him and Ladyfag called him up to the altar. He continued
    as dancing down in the crowd ceased but the energy soared. It was a truly magical moment.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>

     I work as an actor and like to create my own theatrical work whenever possible.
