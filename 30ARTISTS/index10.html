      <h3>"Kayvon's party 'Metropolis' is where I have met most of the incredible friends and inspirations I interviewed & photographed for The Kids Project. Metropolis has kind of
        been a home to me, is where I have found my style/self and I always look forward to seeing most of these incredible artists and designers every Saturday night." - JO


      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My legal name is Kayvon Zand, however growing up in school I went by Kevin and Kayvon at
      home as I am Iranian American. Zand is my mom's last name, who is a direct descendant of
      The Zand Dynasty of Iran. I dropped my legal last name when I turned 18 as my dad didn't do his job.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      I don't have a most magical night, however one of my favorite nights out was when I performed in Vienna for Life Ball- that's what I think of as magic.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
    I love music, many people now in the scene don't know I started as underground musician. I used to have very elaborate and visual stage shows.
    The clubs wanted to have me and my craziness around even if I couldn't perform. Then one thing led to another as well. My oldest passion is piano,
     I am a self taught pianist.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

      Anyone who can make something from nothing. Most of the kids who do these major looks out of nothing and walk the streets and subways remind me of
       what inspires me. They are my celebs, they are my heroes.
