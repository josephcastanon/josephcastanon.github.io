      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My obsession with Andy Warhol and Naomi Campbell, but one of my girls started calling me Nay Nay campbell and it just kind of stuck.
       <br>
        </p>

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    I usually don't remember my nights so perfectly but it was probably the first time I saw Kembra Phaler perform, at Holy Mountain.
      </p>

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
    Hectic, Loving, Inclusive.
    <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
    Stylist, designer, creative direction, memes.
         <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
    I have so many but probably one of them being Holly Golightly, not Hollywood's version, but the original character from Truman Capote.
     She's complex and inspiring, the true character represented a lot of girls and a generation at that.
