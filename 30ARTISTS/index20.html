      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       My club name actually comes from a weirdly dark time--which is only dark technically because of my lack of club name. I desperately wanted to go out and start my drag and club kid career but had not a clue what to call myself. I loved things that had 5 letters and that ended in Y. That's all I knew. One day I was laying in bed lamenting the fact that I didn't have a name and a commercial came on for Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I basically went through the alphabet until I came upon Muffy and there you have it. It also comes from a game I used to play called Harvest Moon, and one of the characters was this super ditsy blonde whore that lived above a bar, and I always loved her archetype so much!

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
       My most magical night out is essentially every single night at Battle Hymn. It is the party I have worked at every week for over a year now, and it is so special to me. It is home, it is safe, it is empowering, and it is free alcohol! I did have a particularly fabulous night in this French Galliano inspired look that I made. I had just gotten dumped, none of my friends showed up, and so I partied alone for a few hours; I went mad! I got home and cried until the sun came up but I felt so wonderful and cleansed after--feelings aren't bad or scary, they can really heal you if you allow yourself to go through them. Battle Hymn helped me do that. And I love it more than anything!

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Muffy is sweet, fun, and always innovative. She is the nicest queen in the scene, that's my reputation. I really, truly love everyone in the scene. I always have a good time and party my ass off. And I am innovative because I make it work for myself and I will always pull a look, no matter my budget or materials!

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      My other interests as a boy are really surrounding writing. I am a writer of fiction, poetry, and personal essays. I think that it helps me develop my emotional artistry, which is then translated into my looks. It's difficult to explain, but my looks are so much less about the style or the actual aesthetic and are really just physical manifestations of my feelings.
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
       I have a few answers for my inspirations actually. First, I HAVE to say Marie Antoinette. She is the PINNACLE of femininity, excess, glamour, and opulence. She is 100% the aesthetic muse of Muffy, there will always be a Marie Antoinette reference in my looks no matter how subtle it may be. I am getting her tattooed on my thigh, she is my true love! The other inspirations of mine are my mother and Mimi. My Mimi is from London, so her class, elegance, and demure attitude juxtaposed with her dry wit are something I have always gravitated towards. Any time I can do a tea, Elizabethan, or British related look I always turn it! My mother is just a strong woman that doesn't let society's view of femininity define her. She will read a bitch if she needs to. But otherwise her strength comes out in her sweetness and care. And those strong women are who I base my drag off of. I am convinced I am a drag queen because of the times I would sit behind her in her vanity just fascinated as she put on her makeup.
