      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       My cousins started calling me Pauli, when I was a kid and I didn't like it at first but it kind of stuck.
       Pauli is the first 5 letters of my government name and Cakes by nature. I remember this boy called me Pauli Cakes
        in an endearing way when I was in the 6th grade and it became my myspace name. It stuck ever since.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      EEEK! I've had so many magical nights out, I can't even pick a favorite.
      I really think the most magical nights entail ending up with people you love to re-cap the night with.
      I've had A LOT of magical nights, all over the world. In my opinion they require lots of love, good music,
      dancing, safety, good drinks and cute looks.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I'm interested in graphic design and using digital art as a major outlet/ I'm also interested in fashion design,
      buying and selling vintage clothing, illustration, etc. I also love to curate crowds and spaces and build installations.
       Different of facets of social activism and bringing people together also interest me and open up new doors for me.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

  Recently, I've been really inspired by alot of animated characters.  Betty Boop's character in particular, she is such a
  fearless and cute matriarch and I love her looks. I've been channeling her a lot. I've developed an alter ego named Petty
  Boop she is like cute and quirky but reads people to filth. I'm also constantly inspired by all of my friends who encourage
   me to push my boundaries creatively, I'm totally fueled off of their love.
