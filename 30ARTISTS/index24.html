 <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
<p>
  I like the irony of using my own name.
</p>
   <br>

<h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
<p>
 My first night out in NY. It was at On Top and I met a ton of the friends I still keep today. There's just nothing like a rooftop party full of queens outside in NY. </p>
 <br>

<h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
<p>
 Creative, goofy, deliberate.</p>
   <br>

<h3>"What are your other interests outside of
 the club?"</h3>
<p>
 Drawing, painting, graphic design, being in nature.</p>
 <br>

<h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
<p>
  I've admired Amanda Lepore ever since my manager at MAC in college showed me a video where she gets covered in Candy Yum Yum. Such a brave trailblazer.</p>
