      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       My club name is just my own name and I kept it like that because I don't think my club personality is too different from my regular.
       <br>
        </p>

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    I don't know if I can pick a most magical night out but the first time I ever went out was pretty exciting, dunno if it was the best but
     it definitely did something since I'm still going.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
    Butch queen realness.
    <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a photo major but I started with a fine art background so I also illustrate
         <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      my biggest inspo would probably be the directly Ridley Scott, just because the Alien movies are like my everything
       and all of my work has a kind of horror/ sci-fi undertone.
