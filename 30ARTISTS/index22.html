      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       It's actually my real name. I always have said if I had made it up it would be super cheesy, but since it's my given birth name I guess it makes it better. The pun is that I am "Just an angel".
    </p>

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      It was the first night someone took me to The Box. It was the first time I had experienced something like that. It was a super exclusive club at the time and we were let right in because of our looks, I would soon see a transgendered women pulling a fake baby out of her ass and setting it on fire for an emotional abortion act when I walked in. Little did I know that would be my main place of employment (hosting) for the next 3 years and still going! </p>

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Sweetheart, Fashion, Cunt.
        <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I love knowing all I can about Fashion history. It's a hobby that comes in handy when putting together looks, just the overall knowledge and referencing I have on hand is because of that tedious studying.
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
       Fashion wise Gareth Pugh, and other than that my mom.
