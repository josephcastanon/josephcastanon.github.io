      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My club name comes from my real life name.
        </p>
        <br>

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
       I’m always stuck between the first night I ever went out and my first time at the Box. I think there's always this sense of mystery and awe every time you go to a new party for the first time, because you don’t know what to expect.
      </p>
      <br>

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      The three words I would use are Art, Occult and Celestial or like Catholic School Nightmare.
    </p>
        <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
    I’m really interested in the worlds of art and music, I find them both really fascinating and being an artist. I really really respect and appreciate the time and effort that go into all aspects of it. </p>
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
       I would say that my biggest inspiration would probably be either Imp Queen or Nicole Dollanganger, because they both are very much in control of their vision, image, and their art and create things how they perceive they should be, and its something that I respect and appreciate.
