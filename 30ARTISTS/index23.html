      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       My family has a long tradition of making eggs benedict every Sunday.  Plus eggs are versatile and I like to think I am too.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      My most magical night out was taking molly in the bathroom stall of Slake with my two best friends and then immediately getting our tarot cards read as we came up (and then dancing for three more hours).  Haven’t done molly in the club since, but I don’t think much could top that night. </p>

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Whimsical, Majestic, Awkward (Flazeda?)
        <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      Food/restaurants, theater.. kind of...
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
       Taylor Mac and Machine Dazzle— they started out in the club scene and made their own rules, now they have one of the most unique art forms I’ve ever seen.  Plus they don’t take themselves too seriously.  Thank god.
