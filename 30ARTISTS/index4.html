      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       The name I'm currently going by (luxurycarcass) is supposed to be a contradiction.
       I'm really interested in juxtapositions, and how different concepts interact with one another cohesively.
       This is something I always try to touch on in my art.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      That's tough to say, but probably one of the many nights at Susanne Bartsch's seasonal party OnTop.
      It's a perfect setting for hot summer nights, and nobody tops Susanne's style of throwing extravaganzas.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Ephemeral, unbiased, and unpredictable.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      Outside of looks, I create visual art (drawing, painting, and installation), and am currently training
      to be a makeup artist / esthetician. I would also like to get back into performance art in the near future.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      I definitely have countless influences and interests; however, I don't believe my art necessarily derives
      from anyone in particular. It is more or less a visual representation of my inner thoughts and feelings;
      an exaggerated yet pure version of my true self. My intention behind everything I do is exist vividly
      outside of any and all imposed margins.
