      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      In elementary school, kids used to tease me and call me Celery because I guess thats all they could come up with. So I kinda "took back the night" and now I use it to brand myself.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      The most magical, I think, was the first time I ever went out. It
      was one of Susanne Bartsch’s parties, and I think I met you and
      Josh there too, but Milk performed and I even met Sharon
      Needles.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Listener, unstable, and background.</p>
        <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      My other interests are pretty much fashion, and clothing related
      things. Other than obsessing about certain people, I guess I’m
      interested in health and wellness too.</p>
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      My biggest inspiration is John Waters, because he was the first
      person that ever made me feel normal, or at least not alone. I
      owe him like everything, coming to New York, starting fashion,
      starting drag...</p>
