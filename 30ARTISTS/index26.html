<h3>"Where did your club name come from?"</h3>
<p>
 The critically-acclaimed film "Heathers" along side being obsessed with 80's/90's models. I decided on the ever-so androgynous Grace Jones. Clash them together and you get this wannabe secret agent runway assassin Heather Jones.
 </p>
 <br>

 <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
 <p>
  My first night ever performing (by a former alias of course), because I ended up getting kicked out. Hence the former alias. </p>
  <br>


<h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
<p>
 Love, Laughter, and Glamour.</p>
   <br>

<h3>"What are your other interests outside of
 the club?"</h3>
<p>
 All of my interests include anything with beauty and opulence. If you're asking how I make a coin, I am a make up artist to the deceased. </p>
 <br>

<h3>"What is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
<p>
  Death. Death inspires me to keep loving and make choices that make me happy enough to know I will transition in Love, Laughter, and Glamour.</p>
