       <h3> JO is the creator of The Kids Project and all photos for The Kids Project were taken by him at Kayvon Zand's "Metropolis".

      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My birth name is Joseph, but I've always gone by Joe. In high school, I had to do a project where I had to
      choose an emotion to correspond to each letter of my first name and I couldn't think of anything for the letter "e"
      so I just went with JO and it kind of stuck since. JO is more ambigious than Joe and I like to be as enigmatic
      as possible.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    There's been so many magical nights, but there is nothing quite like the magic and the feeling that comes along with going out in
    a look for the first time. The first time I went out was to On Top and it was such a liberating experience and fulfilled so many
    of the dreams and expectations I had for the city.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Disco Dumpster Clown.
    <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently studying Communication Design at Parsons The New School for Design and am constantly building my photography, art, and design work.
      I've lived passed lives as a working child actor, performer, singer/songwriter, and now... I'm a sparkly clown who only comes out at night. I like stepping out of my comfort zone
      and challenging myself in new fields of art, design & entertainment.. Thinking about taking up juggling next.
         <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      Andy Warhol. He is everything I long to be and aspire towards. I ask myself "What would Warhol do?" everytime I have to make decisions and I will continue
      to try to bring the Warholian spirit of art, design, collaboration, and publication back into NYC queer nightlife.
