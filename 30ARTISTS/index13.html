      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
      My club name (Jupiter) found its way into my life long before I started going to clubs. I began studying astrology during the summer before 6th grade.
      I have always had an obsession with the relative positions of celestial bodies interpreted as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world.
       While studying all the planets in our immediate solar system I felt a very strong (almost spiritual) connection to the planet Jupiter.
        The symbol of Jupiter (♃) has a meaning that is closely aligned with the idea of manifestation, because of the position of Jupiter in our solar system.
        It rests in the center of the orbital line of planets, with four planets preceding it, and four planets extending past it.
         This position of balance makes the energy of Jupiter ideal for justice, manifestation and perfect order. Some symbolic meanings of Jupiter:
        expansion, protection, wealth, abundance, higher education, optimism, generosity, justice and balance. All characteristics I want people to associate with me when
         they think of me as a person, artist or club kid. <br>
        </p>

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    The first night I stepped out in drag. why? because nothing felt better than spending 4 hours on doing my makeup and taking that last look in the mirror
    before I left the house knowing that I had an entire network of people that respected the person I was and the type of artwork I produce.
      </p>

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
    Glamorous, graceful & grotesque.
    <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I am current immersed in the world of ceramics and it has always been something I had interested in. I am also interested in other forms of sculpture
       and painting! I also really like to dance. I don't think i'm any good at it but really enjoy moving through space care free, and if that translates
       to me voguing at the center of a dance floor i'm happy with that. I want to say i'm interested in every experience I give myself,so currently that
        means i'm really interested in design and creative direction. Fashion has always been something I have been interested in. Early on I understood
        that fashion is something that every single person can relate to in some form. I knew that I wanted to allow my viewers to have the opportunity to
         deeply connect to my artwork and decided fashion was the perfect way to do that.
         <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      I take inspiration from a lot of different things present in my life, but if I had to place my inspiration in a who my answer would be Rei Kawakubo.
      Since founding Comme des Garçons  in 1969, Rei Kawakubo has consistently defined and redefined the aesthetics of our time. Season after season,
       collection after collection, she upends conventional notions of beauty and disrupts accepted characteristics of the fashionable body.
       Her fashion not only stand apart from the genealogy of clothing but also resist definition and confound interpretation. An aesthetic sensibility
        that establishes an unsettling zone of visual ambiguity and elusiveness is something I have always respected about her work, and is something I
         would like to bring forth in my own work.
