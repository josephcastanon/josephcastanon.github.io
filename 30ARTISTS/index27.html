          <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
          <h4> "The Kids Project was created in 2017 as culmination of all of the talented and inspirational artists I have met over the last year at various clubs in NYC.
            All of the people featured on this site are not just inspirations to me, but I'm so grateful to call most of them my friends. Discover these
            incredible artists by reading their interviews & seeing the photos I took of them by clicking the "Meet the Kids" link directly below. I hope
            to continue this project by inducting new Kids monthly and creating a resource/encyclopedia of those ruling the NYC queer club scene."
