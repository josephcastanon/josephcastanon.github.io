      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       Back when I was coming up with names, I knew I wanted to have a one that was gross.
       One of my friends and I would get really stoned and spitball drag names back and forth,
       and Malestia Daughters somehow came up so I figured the last name should be Child,
       just to be an equally opportunity offender. Big Peg was another I was quite fond of.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      Right around when I first started going out in looks, I was headed to On Top (of course)
      and we had to get out of our car like a block and a half early because there was construction.
      This couple walks out of some bar and the guy asks if he and his wife could take a picture with us.
      Everyone involved pretty drunk and we start talking with them. He introduced himself, and
      then his wife says "I'm Mel" in a think Leeds accent (which I only know because of her).
      Upon hearing her Leeds accent I blurt out "like Spice Girls Mel?" Which she nodded yes to.
      We ended up sitting on some shop stoop and talking for like an hour and she bummed half a
      pack of cigs from my friend. She was inspiring to me as a kid, so that was a pretty
      magical experience.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Colorful, loud, lewd.

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I've recently gotten into gardening, which is rally just me buying plants and keeping most of them alive.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>

    I think I'll go with Tim Burton out of my countless people and things that I'm inspired by, because I think
    being obsessed with Nightmare Before Christmas at a very young age really set a certain trajectory for the
    evolution of my visual style.
