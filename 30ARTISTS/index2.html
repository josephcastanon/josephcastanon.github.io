     <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
    So I started off my drag career with a different name than I have now.
    My first name I picked because I thought it was pretty. Once I got a bit
     more in touch with who I am as a drag persona I ended up choosing
     "Phallic Cunt," which happens to rhyme with my real name Alec Blunt.
     The moment I figured it out something clicked and I knew that it had
    be my drag name. A lot of my creative aesthetic, in and out of drag is
    about juxtaposing masculinity and femininity in provocative ways. The
    name Phallic Cunt pretty much sums that up for you.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
    My most magical night out would probably be the first time I went out
    with my drag sister Celery (Ellory) to On Top, a party out on by Susanne
    Bartsch. I had just moved back to NYC (after taking a year off of school
    to get sober from a two year long addiction) and had decided that I
    wanted to take drag a bit more seriously this time around. It was wonderful
    watching the amazement on my sister's face at all the glamorous characters
    in the club. She told me she felt like she finally belonged somewhere. And
    that is the wonderful thing about the clubs; that it's this home or rather
    community where you can be you or someone else or just live your
    ultimate fantasy and you're accepted.

    <h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
    <p>
      Provocative, silly, and loving.</p>
        <br>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of the club?"</h3>
    <p>
    By day I am attending school to become a fashion designer, which takes up
    a majority of my time. I spend a great deal of energy working on making garments
    and this work truly feeds my soul. Sobriety is also of great importance
    to me and I do commit a decent amount of time each week to keeping my sobriety
    in tact. I love movies, Netflix, and television (esp. RuPaul's Drag Race.) And
    I have to confess I am quite the connoisseur of desserts.

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      There are a lot of people that inspire me. So I'm going to have to pick two.
      First is David Wojnarowicz, who was an artist in NYC in the 80's/early 90's.
      His work has a lot to do with the development of personal iconography.
      I am a big fan of integrating personalized symbols into my work. David also
      produced work relating to the AIDS crisis while it was happening, when many
      felt afraid to speak out about the epidemic. This kind of activism integrated
      into art really speaks to me. I feel as a designer/performer/artist it is
      ones duty to address difficult social issues to begin a dialogue, with the
      intention of creating some sort of societal shift. My second inspiration is
      Leigh Bowery. My drag doesn't necessarily conform to looking like a woman.
      Leigh Bowery's looks were transcendent of gender and he was always creating
      new looks that not only were shocking or glamorous, (depending on your viewpoint)
      but his looks also utilized the device of storytelling, which is the mark of a
      true artist if you ask me.</p>
