<h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
<p>
 My first night out with JO at On Top was definitely the most magical, since it was something so new and the excitement made it incredible. </p>
 <br>

<h3>“Describe yourself in 3 words.”</h3>
<p>
 Classy, sassy & white-trashy.</p>
   <br>

<h3>"What are your other interests outside of
 the club?"</h3>
<p>
 I'm a fashion design major at Parsons and love music, my friends, and pizza. </p>
 <br>

<h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
<p>
  My Mom. Her willingness to learn and open-ness to discovery is something I have always admired, as well as her big heart and loving personality. I'm a Momma's boy.</p>
