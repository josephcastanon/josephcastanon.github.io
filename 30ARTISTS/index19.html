      <h3>“Where did your club name come from?”</h3>
     <p>
       My drag name is my given name, Ada. I know thats of a cop out but I like my name. I might change it at some point, but at the moment I'm still finding my drag "aesthetic" and exploring my options creatively. Sometimes I go by A Duh.

    <h3>"What was your most magical night out?"</h3>
    <p>
      I moved to New York from Michigan on my own in September. I wasn't going to college so I kind of said "Fuck it" and came here to work and focus on my art.
      Point is I'm pretty new to the scene, but I'd say my most memorable night out was probably my first night in drag. It was about 4 months ago at Kayvon Zand's Metropolis, I wore a pink plastic geisha look I made out of stuff from the dollar store. I remember all night being really shocked at how empowered I felt. I've loved and admired drag from a very young age, my babysitters were queens, but as a woman it felt so out of reach for me. Which is crazy if you think about it, the idea that women shouldn't be allowed to participate in female impersonation or deserve less credit for it is fucking absurd. Especially considering the sexist origins of drag in theatre.

    <h3>“How would you describe your style?”</h3>
    <p>
      I'm still finding my vibe, but at the moment I'd describe my drag style as dollar store realness. Cause I make all my looks the day of and they are almost always made of plastic table cloths and other things from the dollar store. She's a budget queen.</p>

    <h3>"What are your other interests outside of
      the club?"</h3>
    <p>
      I came to New York to work of my photography and visual art. I never thought I'd start doing drag, but I'm head over heels for it. I've been doing photography and filmmaking since I was 12 and it was my driving passion through high school, honestly the main reason I lived through that time in my life. I wanted to come to New York to be somewhere with more opportunities and to be around more creatives. I planned to work as a photographer, and I'm doing that, but since I moved here I've been exploring so many other mediums I never thought I'd get to do. I've done a little acting, modeling, performance art, and drag. I really think I'm where I need to be.</p>
      <br>

    <h3>"Who is your biggest inspiration?"</h3>
    <p>
      Its really hard to say who my biggest inspiration is, I admire so many people. I think I'm most inspired by strong, creative women & femmes in the drag scene who break boundaries and generally slay. Legends like Amanda Lepore and Susanne Bartsch. </p>
