<p align="left">
“Perhaps that dichotomy was a sign of his design talent, as he was habituated to both problem solving and aesthetic values.” (89) <br>
I found this introduction to Bill Atkinson to be quite interesting, as someone who had never heard of Atkinson or the Apple Lisa prior to <br>
this reading. It’s not that common to find people that have duel careers in something as traditional as neurochemistry and as artistic as <br>
photography/design. I connect to Atkinson in this way because I have a deep fascination with astronomy, as well as photography, design, <br>
and fashion. Another thing I admire about Atkinson was his focus on the user interaction as a guide to the building the software. He <br>
seemed to actually enjoy the process of trial and error, rebuilding code, numerous user tests, and even unsuccessful attempts at an idea. <br>
I often settle on an idea and could benefit from applying more of Atkinson’s ideas in my own process.<br>
<br>
 I also found the passage about the Pull-Down Menus to be particularly interesting, since it followed the feature from it’s initial <br>
 conception as an idea, through the many iterations and trials, and finally on it’s success as a final product. Placing the menu on the top <br>
 of the screen rather then on the top of the window seems insignificant, but it’s decisions like that, that are thoroughly tested and agreed <br>
upon, that makes all the difference for the user. The software should seem like a comprehensive language that only aids the user and you <br>
can tell Atkinson followed through with this through many trials for his softwares. The reading was inspiring to someone like myself,<br>
who constantly feels frustrated and overwhelmed by coding, that it’s all about trial and error. You can’t expect something to work <br>
seamlessly the first time and once you accept that you will have to edit things, perform tests, and possibly even start over from scratch, <br>
you free yourself of that burden of failure and open yourself up purely to new, ambitious ideas.
